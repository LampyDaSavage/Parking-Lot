1st Commit:

Created two files - parkingLot.java and parkingLotMain.java

Language Used and Reason - I wanted to start this project with either java or python as they
were both OOP languages that I was familiar with. I decided to choose java over python because
I had more experience with java OOP and Data structures and decided that if it starts to get
messy or complicated after 500+ lines of code I will rewrite what I have in python and continue
from there.

Progress - I have created the "back-end" file which is the parkingLot.java file to make a
parkingLot object. It is stored using a hashtable because a hashtable is a good data structure
for storing data, inserting, and deleting. It has one private field which is the hashtable and 
some methods such as parking and unparking at the lot, and getting the status of a parking lot
slot. The main file which is the parkingLotMain.java, utilizes the parkinglot object to then ask 
the user if they would like to park or unpark their "car" from one of the slots. 

Things to note - The scan type in the main file when asking which spot to park inis an int which 
right now, if the user enters any other data type the code breaks but if a front-end is added then 
they will only have a very specific choice to pick from and then all the other conditions in place 
to prevent the program from breaking can be removed as well. If the scan type needs to be fixed so 
that the program doesn't break at its current state then you can make the input type a string and then 
try parsing int which if done successfully, they entered a valid input and you can proceed to check the
rest of the conditions.

2nd Commit:

Documentation - Documented the constructor in the ParkingLot.java file to explain what the constructor does

Name Conventions - Class names are normally in upper camelcase and I wrote them as lower camelcase so I changed the
class names to follow the convention and to adjust everything else I changed the file names to match them and then
changed the constructor and modified line 8 in ParkingLotMain.java to construct the parkingLot object properly

3rd Commit:

QOL Changes - Previously the parking lot size was fixed to 10 in both the object file and main file but now it is
stored in a variable. I also made a get method that'll access the private variable and replaced all the fixed values of
10 with the get method so that if the "size" of the parking lot ever expands then you just have to change the value
of the variable to update everything else that uses it.
