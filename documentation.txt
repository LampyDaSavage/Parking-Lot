Created two files - parkingLot.java and parkingLotMain.java

Language Used and Reason - I wanted to start this project with either java or python as they
were both OOP languages that I was familiar with. I decided to choose java over python because
I had more experience with java OOP and Data structures and decided that if it starts to get
messy or complicated after 500+ lines of code I will rewrite what I have in python and continue
from there.

Progress - I have created the "back-end" file which is the parkingLot.java file to make a
parkingLot object. It is stored using a hashtable because a hashtable is a good data structure
for storing data, inserting, and deleting. It has one private field which is the hashtable and 
some methods such as parking and unparking at the lot, and getting the status of a parking lot
slot. The main file which is the parkingLotMain.java, utilizes the parkinglot object to then ask 
the user if they would like to park or unpark their "car" from one of the slots. 

Things to note - The scan type in the main file when asking which spot to park inis an int which 
right now, if the user enters any other data type the code breaks but if a front-end is added then 
they will only have a very specific choice to pick from and then all the other conditions in place 
to prevent the program from breaking can be removed as well. If the scan type needs to be fixed so 
that the program doesn't break at its current state then you can make the input type a string and then 
try parsing int which if done successfully, they entered a valid input and you can proceed to check the
rest of the conditions.
