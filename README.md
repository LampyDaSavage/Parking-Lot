# Parking-Lot
A project that makes a website to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain a parking lot management system. The main goal is to practice system deployment and tackle any issues that arise as well as implement more features along the way. A parking lot management system is a good choice for this because the ideas for expansion are vast and almost unlimited.
